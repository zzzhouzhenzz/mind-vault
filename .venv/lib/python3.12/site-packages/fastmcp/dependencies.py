"""Dependency injection exports for FastMCP.

This module re-exports dependency injection symbols to provide a clean,
centralized import location for all dependency-related functionality.

DI features (Depends, CurrentContext, CurrentFastMCP) work without pydocket
using the uncalled-for DI engine. Only task-related dependencies (CurrentDocket,
CurrentWorker) and background task execution require fastmcp[tasks].
